            <p>A subtle yet pervasive issue unfolds its wings across the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) Systems landscape, and it goes beyond the technical and operational aspects – it taps into the fundamental dynamics of how stakeholders, including transit operators, agencies, and even passengers, navigate through their daily transactions and operational protocols: Vendor lock-in. <a href="/publications/2022/09/24/afc-vendor-lock.html">Read More...</a></p>

            <h2><a href="/publications/2021/04/11/navigating-pitfalls-investments-afc.html">Navigating the Pitfalls of Illusionary Investment in AFC Systems</a></h2>
            <p>In the realm of Automated Fare Collection Systems (AFCS), the advent of investment projects, typically characterized as BOO (Build-Own-Operate) or BOOT (Build-Own-Operate-Transfer) models, often promenade as promising pathways towards seamless implementation and operational efficiency. However, a deeper delve into the practices often unveils a myriad of issues that taint the purported investment strategy with layers of complexity and hidden challenges. <a href="/publications/2021/04/11/navigating-pitfalls-investments-afc.html">Read More...</a></p>

            <h2><a href="/publications/2020/03/08/pt-not-playground.html">Public Transport: A Crucial Infrastructure, Not a Testing Ground</a></h2>
            <p>In numerous instances, public transport inadvertently becomes a launching pad or, to use a precise term, a "springboard" for innovations and fledgling technologies. One might struggle to envision such experiments in domains like nuclear industry or medicine, posing a question that often goes unspoken: Why does this phenomenon permeate transport? For neophytes or those lacking depth in the field, public transport may exude an illusion of simplicity, presenting itself as an entity that is inherently comprehensible and transparent. <a href="/publications/2020/03/08/pt-not-playground.html">Read More...</a></p>

            <p>Automated Fare Collection (AFC) Systems are often hailed as heralds of innovation in the transit sector, particularly for their capability to introduce modern payment options. However, it is pivotal to understand that the profundity of AFC systems transcends beyond merely facilitating diverse payment methodologies. <a href="/publications/2019/11/27/unveiling-afc-essence.html">Read More...</a></p>

            <p>While the digital wave prominently reshapes multiple industries, it has also significantly impacted the realm of public transit, introducing Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems. However, there's an often-overlooked player in this digital transformation – the AFC System Operator. <a href="/publications/2019/07/15/the-role-of-afc-operators.html">Read More...</a></p>
